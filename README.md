# Hello, this is my dotfiles!

Welcome to my dotfiles repo! These dotfiles defines my development setups across work, side projects, etc. I regularly update these dotfiles as I find glitches and fix them gradually.

## Development Tools
Here's a list of my essential tools for development. Feel free to try them out, they are great!

- **MacBook**: I use MacBook as my `display` workstation, and I have a headless home server in Linux that shares most of the configs in this repo. I can switch between macos and linux when I install the dotfiles to correctly install platform dependent configs.
- **HHKB Keyboard**: I use the HHKB keyboard for most of my development work. It needs a bit of effort to get used to but having Control key at the usual CapLock location is very convenient for vim users.
- **Ghostty**: my go-to terminal simulator choice. I've tried many terminal simulators (iterm2/hyper/warp/alacritty) but found Ghostty to be much simpler and fast to use.
- **Neovim (LazyVim distro)**: my code editor. I use the lazyvim distro due to its simplicity (I like simple but working tools!). The neovim configs are updated frequently to fit my development needs for side projects or at work.
- **Zsh (Pretzo distro and p10k theme)**: my terminal config and theme are controlled by pretzo and p10k. Pretzo is simpler than oh-my-zsh and p10k provides useful visual prompts.
- **Karabiner (custom key binding)**: I use some custom key bindings that help with my wrist health.
  - swap control and caplock when I don't have my HHKB keyboard with me.
  - map tapped shift key to left/right parentheses.
  - map tapped control to esc (useful for vim to switch modes).
- **Hammerspoon (window control)**:
  - Ctrl+Alt/Opt+a: resize current window to left half of the current screen.
  - Ctrl+Alt/Opt+s: resize current window to right half of the current screen.
  - Ctrl+Alt/Opt+e: resize current window to left 2/3 of the current screen.
  - Ctrl+Alt/Opt+t: resize current window to right 2/3 of the current screen.
